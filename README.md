# Correlation

Question: are MSCI World (IWDA) and/or STI (ES3) "correlated enough" to be a substitute for an emerging-market allocation (through EEM US or EIMI LN) in a Singapore investor's portfolio?

Answer: probably not, but the EEM/EIMI allocation would be too small to have a meaningful effect on the investor's portfolio anyway.

Correlation of returns:                  

|| Return (EEM) | Return_sti_usd |Return_iwda|
|---|---|---|---|
|    Return (EEM)   |       1.000000     |   0.837048   |  0.826327|
|    Return_sti_usd  |0.837048   |     1.000000   |  0.730374|
 |   Return_iwda  |   0.826327      |  0.730374  |   1.000000|

...so the STI (in US dollars) is about as correlated with EEM as IWDA is, but STI and IWDA aren't as strongly correlated with each other. 

You'd get better diversification, but the allocation to EIMI would be about 4-5%; even if it outperforms significantly, it's not going to make more than a few tenths of a percentage point difference to the total portfolio returns.
